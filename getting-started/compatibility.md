# Compatibility

The `Java 8` is a minimum Java version required to run Konsist.

Konsist works with any test framework that executes Kotlin code such as [JUni4](https://junit.org/junit4/) and [JUnit5](https://junit.org/junit5/). It is also compatible with popular build systems such as [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) and [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).

Konsist is compatible with [Spring](https://spring.io/), and [Android](https://www.android.com/) projects.&#x20;
