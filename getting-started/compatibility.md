# Compatibility

The `Java 8` is a minimum Java version required to run Konsist.

Konsist is compatible with all Kotlin projects including [Spring](https://spring.io/), and [Android](https://www.android.com/) projects.&#x20;

Konsist works with any test framework that executes Kotlin code, however, is it recommended to use [JUni4](https://junit.org/junit4/) or [JUnit5](https://junit.org/junit5/).&#x20;

Konsist is compatible with popular build systems such as [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) and [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).
