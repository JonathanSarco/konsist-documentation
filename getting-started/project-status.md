# Project Status

Konsist library has been field-tested on multiple Spring and Android projects with both Gradle and Maven build systems. On top of that Konists has a solid suite of tests (1300+ tests and 20 unique checks).

There is still some work to do, however, it is safe to use, because Konsist will is not a part of the application production code - used to verify the code base.
